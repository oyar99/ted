     * Input: 
     * 
     * The program receives two Trees T1 and T2 and returns a 
     * number d that indicates the number of elementary operations required to transform 
     * T1 into T2.
     * 
     * The program accepts the following arguments
     * 
     *      "ZhangShasha"
     * 
     *          This will run an exact algorithm that uses dynamic programming to find a solution.
     *          This algorithm is one of the building blocks for the approximation scheme.
     * 
     *          Time complexity: O(n^4)
     * 
     *      "Saeed"
     * 
     *          This will run an exact algorithm that uses a variant of the algorithm described in the paper
     *          1+Ïµ Approximation of Tree Edit Distance in Quadratic Time.
     * 
     *          Time complexity: O(n^6)
     * 
     * The input should follow these rules.
     * 
     *      The input contains two trees T1 and T2 represented as strings that correspond
     *      to the pre-order traversal of T such that when we visit node u, we append 
     *      label(u) followed by a matching parenthesis that encloses the subtree rooted at u.
     * 
     *      The first line of the input is the pre-order traversal of T1 as explained above.
     * 
     *      The second line of the input is the pre-order traversal of T2 as explained above.
     * 
     *      
     *      For instance:
     * 
     *      1(2(4())3(5())) is the pre-order traversal for the tree.
     * 
     *                        1
     *                       / \
     *                      /   \
     *                     2     3
     *                    /     /
     *                   4     5
     * 
     *      Note each integer represents a labeled node. As such, there might be duplicated integers
     *      in the string representation of the tree that actually correspond to different nodes.
