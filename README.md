# Tree Edit Distance

Given two node-labeled rooted trees $T$ and $T'$ each of size at most $n$, what is
the minimum number of elementary operations needed to transform $T$ into $T'$?.

This program implements different solutions for the above problem in C++.

## How to run this program?

The program receives two trees $T$ and $T'$ and returns a number $d$ that indicates the number of elementary
operations required to transform $T$ into $T'$.

Given a rooted tree $T$, we can represent the pre-order traversal of $T$ in such a way that when we visit node $u$, we append
$label(u)$ followed by a matching parenthesis that encloses the subtree rooted at $u$. This representation is unique for all possible
trees.

The first line of the input is a string of the pre-order traversal of $T$.
The second line of the input is a string of the pre-order traversal of $T'$.
The program requires the following parameters in the specified order

- The algorithm to use to compute tree edit distance. Either of these values: `ZhangShasha` or `Approx`.

The first option `ZhangShasha` is an implementation of the algorithm described by ZhangShasha in 1989 in the paper
[Simple Fast Algorithms for the Editing Distance between Trees and Related Problems](https://www.proquest.com/docview/919771926) which
runs in $O(n^4)$ time.

```sh
ted.exe < data/sample_5_8.in > output/sample_5_8.out ZhangShasha
```

The second option is an approximation algorithm described in the paper [1+Îµ approximation of tree edit distance in quadratic time](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313276.3316388). The implementation uses $\varepsilon = 1$ and so the algorithm returns an answer that is at most twice the optimal.

```sh
ted.exe < data/sample_5_8.in > output/sample_5_8.out Approx
```
